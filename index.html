      <ol>
      	<li>I'm a hard worker.</li>
      	<li>I'm a constant learner.</li>
      	<li>I have a sincere love for the web.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>I consider myself a <a href="#">jack of all trades</a> when it comes to web.  Some people view a jack of all trades as having a negative connotation, but when it comes to web, I disagree.  Originally starting off as a web designer, I've dove head first into multiple positions where I've had to wear many hats. Just because you're a jack of all trades, doesn't mean you're a master of none.</p>
      <p>Hercules was developed as the successor to the earlier MIM-3 Nike Ajax, with the ability to attack high-flying supersonic targets. It was initially deployed starting in 1959 in new bases, but eventually took over some existing Ajax bases as well. Hercules remained in service far longer than Ajax, with the last units in Europe only being deactivated in 1988.</p>
      <h2>Capabilities</h2>
      <p>The Nike Hercules could carry either a nuclear warhead or a conventional high explosive warhead (T-45 fragmentation type). Initially the nuclear-armed version carried the W-7 Mod 2E nuclear warhead, with yields of 2.5 or 28 kt. Beginning in FY 1961 the older warheads were replaced by W-31 Mod 0 warheads, with yields of 2 kt (Y1) or 30 kt (Y2). The last versions carried the W31 Mod 2 warhead, with yields of 2 or 20 kt. The missile was 41 feet 6 inches (12.65 m) long with a wingspan of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m). 145 missile batteries were deployed during the cold war. The missile had a range of about 77 miles (124 km).</p>
